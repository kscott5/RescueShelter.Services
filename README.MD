This is a simple expressjs api. Its purpose is write only data access. This local development uses mongo docker containers.

### Use your prefered intergated development environment (IDE) or command line interpretor. But,
an VScode-like IDE has a marketplace of extension and plugins in a GUI.
```
npm install --global esbuild typescript
npm install --prefer-dedupe
npm run tsbuild
npm run mongo
npm run redis
docker ps -a
npm run dataset
npm debug
```

The server listens on localhost port 3302, and only accepts HTTP POST request. Jfiddle, Postman, curl and telnet support create POST request.
